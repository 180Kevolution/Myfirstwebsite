<p>
I see myself as kind and humble person who at times start off as an introvert but
once am comfortable I become more of my extroverted self.<br>
I enjoy challenging myself to try new things and most of my friends describe me as
a jovial person with few genius intellects. I can become very emotional at times since<br>
I see myself as more of a lover than a fighter.
I like to treat people fairly since my moral compass is pointing towards love and not hate. <br>
</p>
<p>
I like to stay active through exercises, I love food and like to try new foods.
I like parties when everyone is engage in dancing and having fun.<br>
 I enjoy going to new places and making special memories with friends, and family.
I enjoy listening to music most times and not just one type of genre. <br>
</p>
<p>
I hate that the world doesn’t provide equality for everyone living here.<br>
I really dislike the fact we have to die but that’s how we appreciate being alive, I guess.<br>
When it comes to things I hate, there is not many since am open minded towards most of it. <br>    
<i>if i don't enjoy or like it then i don't do it.</i>
</p>
<p>
I Enjoy being active but I love to just relax and watch <b>movies</b>, <b>shows </b> or <a href="A1 anime.html">anime</a>.<br> 
I grew up close to the sea so I swim well and dancing is kinda one of my thing even though am not the best dancer.<br>
I recently got a camera so I am currently learning how to take some professional style photos from my Photographer housemate.<br>
Therefore, if you are interestered in a <i>Dreams</i> Production photoshoot at a reasonable price you can send an email to <a href="mailto:dreamsproduction24@gmail.com">Keanu Stephenson</a><br>

<h2>My Personality Test Results</h2>
<img src="Assets/Screenshot 2021-01-24 120034.png"<br>
<font size="+2">
<p>
Base on my opinion I don’t think a website can accurately validate someone’s personality <br>
base on a few limited or unrelated questions generated by the website. <br>
However, the results I obtained display a few of the personalities 
I see in myself as an individual and most of the career paths listed <br>by the website have crossed 
<br>my mind throughout my life journey.
