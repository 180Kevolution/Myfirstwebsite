<p><b>
The ability to keep going when things look a bit rough or difficult to continue is 
a feature that I would like to pinpoint as one of my strength.<b></b>
This determination have help me through some really difficult times over the last 5 years of my life.
This feature that I cultivated over these years have contributed to personal growth in ways that improve how<br>
I handle certain situation and it made me more aware of my limitations and capabilities. 
Identifying your limitation is the start to acknowledging your weakness.<br>
However, my ability to quickly adopt to circumstances or environmental 
changes help towards my growth as I tried to become a more mature adult.<br>
Being an adult, patience is a very vital feature to have. The ability to be humble enough 
to wait on something or wise enough to know when to take risks help me over these past 5 years.<br> 
Patience was never one of my strongest feature, however over time I learnt the virtue of absolute patience and now 
I can go through life knowing that whatever I put my mind to will pay off in time.<br>
